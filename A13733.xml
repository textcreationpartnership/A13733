            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>This is the ſumme (ſo well and ſhortly as I could take it) of all that his moſt impertinent Diſcourſe made for an anſwere vnto our aboue ſaid Argument, which yet ſtandeth firme againſt all this babbling, both in the <hi>Antecedent</hi> and in the <hi>Conſequent</hi>: In the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> becauſe firſt there were fiue ſeuerall kinds of Gouernment in <hi>Rome</hi> before Chriſts time, ſince <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> though like in the ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or alonelineſſe, yet differed much both in the name, and the nature of their Gouernment, the <note n="x" place="margin">Liuius lib. <hi>2.</hi>

                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:18994:39"/>
when the <note n="y" place="margin">Dio lib. <hi>43.</hi>
                        </note> name of <hi>Emperour</hi> was giuen moſt gladly vnto <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> and to his Poſteritie after him, as a ſigne of greateſt Soueraignetie: the nature of the Office of the <hi>King</hi> being in their <note n="z" place="margin">Cic. pro C.

                        <hi>Emperour</hi> was accounted the maintainer thereof, all the Offices, (as <hi>Dictator, Pontifex Maximus, Cenſor, &amp; Tribuni Plebis</hi>) being conferd vpon him for terme of his own life, &amp; to his Succeſſours for euer after him; ſince alſo their <hi>Dictator</hi> and <hi>Conſul,</hi> which this ouer-worne <hi>Greeke Antiquarie</hi> would haue confounded, were as farre different in the <hi>Romane</hi> Common-wealths, as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and Prouinciall are now amongſt their King-killing <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> the <note n="b" place="margin">Polyb. lib. <hi>6.</hi>

                        <hi>Conſuls</hi> hauing in obedience and ſubiection all the Offices of the Common-wealth, ſaue the <hi>Tribuni Plebis,</hi> where <note n="c" place="margin">Dionyſ. Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carneſſ. lib. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Dictator</hi> had authoritie aboue the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, although the <hi>Dictators</hi> were ſet vpon the moſt weightie extraordinary occaſions; yet they may well bee ſaid to retaine this ſucceſſion, ſince, when one was to giue it ouer ordinarily at the halfe yeeres end, they either made choice of another or <note n="d" place="margin">Liu. lib. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; Plutarch. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millo.</note> of the ſame man a new, as occaſion ſerued.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the interruption of the <hi>Conſular</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by <hi>Dictators,</hi> and <hi>Tribuni militum,</hi> did not hinder the ſucceſſion of <hi>Conſuls,</hi> (when they were) no more then a vacancie for a Moneth or two, nay, a Yeere, and more ſometimes taketh away the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſucceſſions of <hi>Popes,</hi> ſince ſtill ſome were in place of Gouernment amongſt them to exerciſe due

authoritie till another ſucceeded, as the <hi>Feſti Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum</hi> ſet out by many <note n="e" place="margin">Sigonius, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphri, &amp; Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologi, Funccius, Bunting.

                     <p n="2">2 Our argument is ſound now in the <hi>antecedent,</hi> and ſhall it not ſtand then, I pray you, in the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent?</hi> Yes ſurely, notwithſtanding theſe friuolous exceptions violently thruſt out of a ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conſcience by this coozening-hungry Greeke.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For firſt, what if the <hi>Decemuiri</hi> raigned but two yeeres, and the <hi>Tribuni militum</hi> but fifteene and all the fiue, till <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but ſeuen hundred yeeres? They yet had a ſucceſſion like vnto this of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,</hi> although not ſo long: for the fluxe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is as true in minutes, as it is in yeeres, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not ſo great.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Secondly, what if the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> then flouriſhed moſt, when theſe fiue firſt offices were of principall vſe in <hi>Rome?</hi> This hindered not their ſucceſſion in <hi>Rome,</hi> which (as the Prouerbe is) was not built in one day; but by little and little was to grow vnto that prodigious greatneſſe, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward weighed downe it ſelfe into the duſt. For the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> were to grow vp in their order, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> to follow after them, as <note n="f" place="margin">Dan. 2. &amp; 7. &amp; 8. cap.</note> 
                        <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> hath deliuered in ſundry of his viſions: And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> was not to ſpeake any thing of <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Graecians,</hi> ſince they were all before Chriſt, <hi>Daniel</hi> being the <hi>Prophet</hi> appointed for thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: and ſince <hi>Iohn</hi> was onely to ſpeake of things to fall out either for, or againſt the Church from <hi>Chriſts aſcenſion,</hi> till his ſecond comming: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

he being to ſet forth the ſeate and kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> meddled only with that kingdom which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelfe was to ſurprize, deſcribing it by ſuch tokens of things already paſt, as by which wee may now eaſily define of things preſent, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coniecture of things to come.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thirdly therefore we graunt, that <hi>Rome heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> was firſt but ſmall and weake; but it was to grow vnto her ripeneſſe vnder theſe ſeuen heads one after another: vnder the laſt of all which if it ſtand in moſt continuance, there followeth no abſurdity, ſince the old age in a ſtrong man is commonly the longeſt laſting period of life, but it rather ſheweth the point we proue, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is not one man only, but many ſucceeding one after another, in a kingdome continuing from the yeere of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſixe hundred ſixtie and ſixth, vntill his laſt comming.<note place="margin">Secondly, from the proportion of Faith.</note> For ſo reaſon wil enforce vs to thinke from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith, in that as God worketh good in his children through his moſt rich grace by certaine degrees, according to the <note n="g" place="margin">Marke 4.26.</note> parable of corne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp out of the earth, firſt <hi>the blade, then the eares, after, full corne in the eares</hi>: ſo hereſie will aske ſome time for hatching, becauſe it muſt be wrought into mens conſciences, not by force and rigour, but by plauſible perſwaſions, and colourable conceits, ſince it is hard to remoue a ſettled opinion in any thing, be it true or falſe. <hi>For</hi>
